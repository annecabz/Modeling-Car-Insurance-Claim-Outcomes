In many countries insurance it is a legal requirement to have car insurance in order to drive a vehicle on public roads, so the market is very large!\n","\n","Knowing all of this, On the Road car insurance have requested your services in building a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period. As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to identify the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy, so they can start with a simple model in production.\n","\n","They have supplied you with their customer data as a csv file called `car_insurance.csv`, along with a table detailing the column names and descriptions below."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8928ffdf-25d6-4ad9-909f-0dd8d10b9a42","metadata":{},"source":["\n","\n","## The dataset\n","\n","| Column | Description |\n","|--------|-------------|\n","| `id` | Unique client identifier |\n","| `age` | Client's age: <br> <ul><li>`0`: 16-25</li><li>`1`: 26-39</li><li>`2`: 40-64</li><li>`3`: 65+</li></ul> |\n","| `gender` | Client's gender: <br> <ul><li>`0`: Female</li><li>`1`: Male</li></ul> |\n","| `driving_experience` | Years the client has been driving: <br> <ul><li>`0`: 0-9</li><li>`1`: 10-19</li><li>`2`: 20-29</li><li>`3`: 30+</li></ul> |\n","| `education` | Client's level of education: <br> <ul><li>`0`: No education</li><li>`1`: High school</li><li>`2`: University</li></ul> |\n","| `income` | Client's income level: <br> <ul><li>`0`: Poverty</li><li>`1`: Working class</li><li>`2`: Middle class</li><li>`3`: Upper class</li></ul> |\n","| `credit_score` | Client's credit score (between zero and one) |\n","| `vehicle_ownership` | Client's vehicle ownership status: <br><ul><li>`0`: Does not own their vehilce (paying off finance)</li><li>`1`: Owns their vehicle</li></ul> |\n","| `vehcile_year` | Year of vehicle registration: <br><ul><li>`0`: Before 2015</li><li>`1`: 2015 or later</li></ul> |\n","| `married` | Client's marital status: <br><ul><li>`0`: Not married</li><li>`1`: Married</li></ul> |\n","| `children` | Client's number of children |\n","| `postal_code` | Client's postal code | \n","| `annual_mileage` | Number of miles driven by the client each year |\n","| `vehicle_type` | Type of car: <br> <ul><li>`0`: Sedan</li><li>`1`: Sports car</li></ul> |\n","| `speeding_violations` | Total number of speeding violations received by the client | \n","| `duis` | Number of times the client has been caught driving under the influence of alcohol |\n","| `past_accidents` | Total number of previous accidents the client has been involved in |\n","| `outcome` | Whether the client made a claim on their car insurance (response variable): <br><ul><li>`0`: No claim</li><li>`1`: Made a claim</li></ul> |"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","metadata":{"executionTime":11,"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import required modules\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import logit"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 10000 entries, 0 to 9999\n","Data columns (total 18 columns):\n"," #   Column               Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------               --------------  -----  \n"," 0   id                   10000 non-null  int64  \n"," 1   age                  10000 non-null  int64  \n"," 2   gender               10000 non-null  int64  \n"," 3   driving_experience   10000 non-null  object \n"," 4   education            10000 non-null  object \n"," 5   income               10000 non-null  object \n"," 6   credit_score         9018 non-null   float64\n"," 7   vehicle_ownership    10000 non-null  float64\n"," 8   vehicle_year         10000 non-null  object \n"," 9   married              10000 non-null  float64\n"," 10  children             10000 non-null  float64\n"," 11  postal_code          10000 non-null  int64  \n"," 12  annual_mileage       9043 non-null   float64\n"," 13  vehicle_type         10000 non-null  object \n"," 14  speeding_violations  10000 non-null  int64  \n"," 15  duis                 10000 non-null  int64  \n"," 16  past_accidents       10000 non-null  int64  \n"," 17  outcome              10000 non-null  float64\n","dtypes: float64(6), int64(7), object(5)\n","memory usage: 1.4+ MB\n","Optimization terminated successfully.\n","         Current function value: 0.511794\n","         Iterations 6\n","Optimization terminated successfully.\n","         Current function value: 0.615951\n","         Iterations 5\n","Optimization terminated successfully.\n","         Current function value: 0.467092\n","         Iterations 8\n","Optimization terminated successfully.\n","         Current function value: 0.603742\n","         Iterations 5\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["C:\\Users\\Anne\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_24276\\2048311210.py:14: FutureWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame or Series through chained assignment using an inplace method.\n","The behavior will change in pandas 3.0.
